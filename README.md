'Hello world' Sh-Bash

This is my testing bash shell repo.

All of these scripts are not necessarily should work and finished, it can be
work in progress still yet.

These scripts not only made and edited by me, also other folks have made some
of them, if the author was known -- it was explicitly written.


So if you want to use them, use it for your own risk.
